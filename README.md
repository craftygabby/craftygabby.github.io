Create a repo with the name     <your github username>.githib.io
ie                              craftygabby.github.io

then write your index.html file and commit and push to github
then you can see the live site by googling 'craftygabby.github.io'
or going to setting->pages->visit site

Website will then be updated by github whenever I update, commit, and push new code
